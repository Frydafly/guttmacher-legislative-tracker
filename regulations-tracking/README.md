## 🤖 Still To Do: Automations

You haven't set up the automations yet. Open **`AIRTABLE_FORMULAS_AUTOMATIONS.md`** for:

### Formula Fields to Add
1. **Days Until Expiration** - Countdown for emergency rules
2. **Expiration Status** - Visual indicators (🔴🟡🟢)
3. **Comment Period Days Remaining** - Track deadlines
4. **Priority Alert** - Shows what needs immediate attention

## 📈 What You Now Have

After your import:
- ✅ 96 regulations with complete data
- ✅ 72 Standard Rulemaking regulations
- ✅ 13 Emergency Rules with expiration dates
- ✅ 11 Guidance/Bulletins
- ✅ Enhanced Legal Status (not just "In Effect")
- ✅ All policies captured in text fields

## 🔗 Manual Tasks Remaining

1. **Set Up Automations**: Follow the guide in AIRTABLE_FORMULAS_AUTOMATIONS.md

## 💡 Key Insights from This Project

### What Actually Mattered:
1. **Regulation Type** - Critical for tracking emergency vs standard rules
2. **Expiration Dates** - Calculated for emergency rules (180 days)
3. **Enhanced Legal Status** - Beyond just "In Effect"
4. **Complete Policy Capture** - All specific policies like Doula, lactation, STIs

### What We Learned:
- Airtable can't import links via CSV - must be done manually
- One "Superseded By" field is enough (reverse field handles other direction)
- Intent comes from Policy Categories links, not manual entry
- Text fields are needed as intermediaries for linking

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **TODAY**: Set up the formula fields from the automations guide
2. **THIS WEEK**: Create the 3 critical automations
3. **ONGOING**: Link agencies and policies as you work with the data
