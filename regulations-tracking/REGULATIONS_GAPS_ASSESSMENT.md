# Regulations Tracking - Gaps Assessment & Improvements

**Date**: January 14, 2025

## üî¥ Critical Missing Fields from Original Proposal

### 1. **Regulation Type** (Not in current implementation)
**Why it matters**: Distinguishes between emergency rules (immediate effect), standard rulemaking (normal process), temporary rules, and guidance/bulletins.

**Proposed values**:
- Standard Rulemaking
- Emergency Rule  
- Temporary Rule
- Guidance/Bulletin

**Impact**: Critical for tracking emergency regulations that expire in 60-180 days

### 2. **Supersedes/Superseded By** (Not in current implementation)
**Why it matters**: Tracks when regulations replace each other, maintaining regulatory history

**Implementation**: Link to other Regulations records

### 3. **Intent (access)** (Missing from data)
**Why it matters**: Categorizes regulations as Protective/Restrictive/Neutral like Bills

**Status**: Needs manual review and assignment

## üü° Fields That Need Enhancement

### 1. **Legal Status** 
**Current**: Basic "In Effect" determination
**Enhancement Needed**: More granular statuses:
- In Effect
- Enjoined (court blocked)
- Under Challenge (litigation pending)
- Vacated (struck down)
- Expired (for emergency rules)

### 2. **Expiration Date**
**Current**: Empty for all records
**Needed**: Calculate for emergency regulations (typically Emergency Adopted Date + 180 days)

### 3. **Related Bills**
**Current**: Empty
**Needed**: Link regulations to their enabling legislation

## üü¢ Good Improvements Already Made

### 1. **Agency Hierarchy** ‚úÖ
- Issuing Agency Link connected
- Agency Type lookup from Agencies table
- Priority Level lookup
- Parent Agency tracking

### 2. **Policy Tracking** ‚úÖ
- All specific policies captured (STIs, Doula, lactation, etc.)
- Policy Categories properly mapped
- No missing policy data

### 3. **Date Fields** ‚úÖ
- Comment Period End captured (from Qualification Date)
- All dates properly formatted
- Emergency Adopted Date tracked

## üìä Data Quality Status

### Current Import File Status
- ‚úÖ 96/96 records have Specific Policies
- ‚úÖ 96/96 records have Agency Name
- ‚úÖ All dates properly formatted
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 0/96 have Regulation Type
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 0/96 have Intent assigned
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 0/96 have Expiration Date (for emergency rules)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 0/96 have Related Bills linked

## üöÄ Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Can Do Now)
1. **Add Regulation Type field** - Analyze StateNet data patterns to auto-classify
2. **Calculate Expiration Dates** - For emergency regulations
3. **Enhance Legal Status** - Parse from status text for more granularity

### Requires Manual Review
1. **Assign Intent (Protective/Restrictive/Neutral)** - Needs policy team review
2. **Link Related Bills** - Research which bills enabled each regulation
3. **Identify Supersedes relationships** - Research regulatory history

### Future Enhancements
1. **Comment Period Tracking** - Set up alerts for open comment periods
2. **Expiration Alerts** - Notify when emergency rules near expiration
3. **Legal Challenge Monitoring** - Track court cases affecting regulations

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add Missing Fields to Import
- [ ] Add Regulation Type column
- [ ] Calculate Expiration Date for emergency rules
- [ ] Parse enhanced Legal Status from text

### Phase 2: Manual Data Enhancement
- [ ] Review and assign Intent tags
- [ ] Research and link Related Bills
- [ ] Identify supersedes relationships

### Phase 3: Automation Setup
- [ ] Create views for emergency rules nearing expiration
- [ ] Set up comment period alerts
- [ ] Build legal status monitoring

## üîç Data Insights

### Regulation Types (Inferred from Data)
Based on "Emergency Adopted Date" field:
- **1 Emergency Rule** (has Emergency Adopted Date)
- **95 Standard Rulemakings** (no Emergency Adopted Date)

### Legal Status Distribution
- **79 In Effect** (Adopted/Effective status)
- **7 Pending** (Proposed status)
- **5 Comment Period** (Active public input)
- **4 Under Review**
- **1 Emergency In Effect**

### Priority Agencies
From 62 total agencies:
- **~25 High Priority** (Health Depts, Medicaid, Insurance, Licensing Boards)
- **~37 Low Priority** (Mostly WA community colleges)

## üí° Key Recommendations

1. **PRIORITY**: Add Regulation Type field immediately - critical for tracking emergency rules
2. **IMPORTANT**: Calculate expiration dates for emergency regulations
3. **VALUABLE**: Enhanced Legal Status will help track litigation risks
4. **FUTURE**: Intent assignment needs team review but adds significant value for analysis
