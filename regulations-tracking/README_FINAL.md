- **`regulations_IMPORT_READY.csv`** - The file you just imported
- **`agencies_complete.csv`** - All 62 agencies (if you need to re-import)

#### 📚 Documentation (Keep for ongoing use)
- **`AIRTABLE_FORMULAS_AUTOMATIONS.md`** ⭐ - **USE THIS NEXT** - Set up automations
- **`REGULATIONS_TRACKING_PROPOSAL.md`** - Original vision and structure

## 🤖 Still To Do: Automations

You haven't set up the automations yet. Open **`AIRTABLE_FORMULAS_AUTOMATIONS.md`** for:

### Priority 1: Formula Fields to Add
1. **Days Until Expiration** - Countdown for emergency rules
2. **Expiration Status** - Visual indicators (🔴🟡🟢)
3. **Comment Period Days Remaining** - Track deadlines
4. **Priority Alert** - Shows what needs immediate attention

### Priority 2: Critical Automations
1. **Emergency Rule Expiration Alert** (30-day warning)
2. **Auto-Expire Emergency Rules** (daily check)
3. **Comment Period Alert** (7-day warning)

### Priority 3: Manual Linking
1. Copy agency names from text field to Issuing Agency Link
2. Link regulations to Policy Categories based on "Specific Policies (access)"
3. Identify and link Superseded By relationships as discovered

## 📈 What You Now Have

After your import:
- ✅ 96 regulations with complete data
- ✅ 72 Standard Rulemaking regulations
- ✅ 13 Emergency Rules with expiration dates
- ✅ 11 Guidance/Bulletins
- ✅ Enhanced Legal Status (not just "In Effect")
- ✅ All policies captured in text fields

## 🔗 Manual Tasks Remaining

1. **Link Agencies**: Copy "Agency Name (for linking)" to "Issuing Agency Link"
2. **Link Policies**: Use "Specific Policies (access)" as guide to link to Policy Categories
3. **Set Up Automations**: Follow the guide in AIRTABLE_FORMULAS_AUTOMATIONS.md

## 💡 Key Insights from This Project

### What Actually Mattered:
1. **Regulation Type** - Critical for tracking emergency vs standard rules
2. **Expiration Dates** - Calculated for emergency rules (180 days)
3. **Enhanced Legal Status** - Beyond just "In Effect"
4. **Complete Policy Capture** - All specific policies like Doula, lactation, STIs

### What We Learned:
- Airtable can't import links via CSV - must be done manually
- One "Superseded By" field is enough (reverse field handles other direction)
- Intent comes from Policy Categories links, not manual entry
- Text fields are needed as intermediaries for linking

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **TODAY**: Set up the formula fields from the automations guide
2. **THIS WEEK**: Create the 3 critical automations
3. **ONGOING**: Link agencies and policies as you work with the data
