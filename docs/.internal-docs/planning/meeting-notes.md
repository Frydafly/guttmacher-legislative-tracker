Notes:

- Agenda

  - Purpose: To figure out how the new database can best facilitate the
    website-updating process, making it easier for all involved, and to
    surface any flags and questions about complying with Guttmacher\'s
    security protocols.

  - Outcomes: (1) Fryda has a full understanding of the current process
    for updating Guttmacher's external-facing tracker website. (2) The
    web team has a good understanding of the capabilities of Big Query
    and AirTable. (3) Fryda and project team gain understanding of
    internal security protocols that we will need to address (4)
    Alignment on what the ideal process/format is, or on next steps for
    determining it.

  - Process: Discussion

    - Agenda:

      - \* Introductions (5 min)

      - \* Web team walks through the current process, including any
        current pain points (15 min)

      - \* Database demo by Fryda, highlighting those aspects of most
        interest to the web team (10 min)

      - \* Conversation about what the ideal process would be, given the
        flexibility offered by AirTable and Big Query (10 min)

      - \* IT talks through any security protocols needed (10 minutes)

      - \* Align on next steps (5 min)

- Current process and pain points:

  - They get a csv file that they have to convert to XML that gets read
    into a script, and there are some validation issues that need to be
    worked on to fix

    - There have been issues with the dates and formatting of special
      characters, then they have to do a manual replace

  - Devan: As far as the new system, making sure the structure of the
    database does not change

  - Louis: the structure of the database should change quite a bit → we
    need a hierarchy for the current display of our pages

  - Process

    - Csv

    - Import it to separate database

  - Page on website is built by Aten?! ← is that the name?

Action Items:

- Sample

Questions for Lenny

Access Database Structure

1.  Can you show me the table structure, relationships, and schema of
    the current Access database?

    a.  Only two tables

        i.  Subpolicies → list of subpolicies

        ii. Main table with, one line per bill, all those columns

2.  What are all the required fields and their data types?

3.  Are there any special triggers or automated processes built into the
    database? nope

Export Requirements

1.  Can you provide a full export of the 2024 database (particularly
    focused on pre-filed bills)?

2.  What\'s the best format for this export to preserve all data types
    and relationships?

Notes

- Sql server of all the data is in sql server (can be migrated over!)

- Wants written permission from state to give me data

- Concerns about

  - Longevity, security

  - Airtable, google tools

Action items

- Jose and Lenny will get airtable set up, register account with
  helpdesk email account

- Invite from airtable

**Questions**

Blurb Review Process:

- Walk me through your current workflow for reviewing blurbs

- What are you specifically checking for?

- How do you coordinate with Peter\'s editorial review?

Bill Tracking:

- When do Mollie & Talia typically need your legal expertise?

  - More complicated bill

- Any standard criteria for when they should consult you?

New System Needs:

- What would make your review process more efficient?

- Must-have features for legal review workflow?

- How would you want to track/add comments?

Rules & Regs:

- Should the new system handle regulations differently than legislation?

- Different review needs for regs?

Notes

- Kimya helps keep these things up to date

  - Interactive map

  - State law and policy

- The tracker is the way in which kimya is alerted to changes in state
  law

- The way things work right now, there isn't that much of a need to
  change process, as its ok for mollie and talia to just reach out

- When i check the bill, its an accuracy check, often human error --
  **occasionally some issues with statenet just functionality in that
  sometimes there will be amendments introduced or something will happen
  and mollie and talia won't be alerted-- so they will write the blurb
  based off of the version that they saw in statenet.**

- Kimya has used other databases in the past that felt better:
  FiscalNote, Quorum\*\*, CapitalCanary (maybe acquired)

- Tracker improvement -- given internal capacity as a team -- the
  categories we use in our tracker are fairly broad -- sometimes that
  will be tough because i will look for a specific thing and i don't
  know what category it is nested under.

- One other big challenge with our current system as a whole is that
  often times, I am tasked with reporting out what is going on in the
  states, taking a wide view of all 50 states, and that happens in media
  requests as well as reports I write for the organization, but the way
  our current system is -- if i wanna know how many states have
  introduced a bill related to XYZ thing and its not on our database, I
  have to ask mollie and talia to pull that information -- i'd like to
  easily pull that information myself. The database allows me to see
  which states have passed or vetoed legislation, but that number
  information always has to come from mollie and talia. In our reports
  where we do a big tallie of provisions, that count takes them a really
  long time.

- PROVISIONS VS BILLS -- separate them out!

Action items

- ~~Can you send me some sample reports you try to put together?

## Dec 18, 2024 \| [Meet with Fryda (Talia Curhan)](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=bjRjdWQzMGdtNm9ib2lubjJxMjRwMmZxZ2sgZnJ5ZGEuZ3VlZGVzQG0)

Current Understanding to Verify

- Tues/Thurs workflow:

  - Mollie generates Excel from StateNet

  - Upload to Asana, split work

  - Update/create records in Access

- Bi-monthly (1st/15th):

  - Collect enacted/vetoed legislation

  - Draft → Kimya review → Peter edit → Website blurbs

  - XML file to web team via Asana

Key Questions

1.  StateNet & Files

    - When you open emails from StateNet - what exactly are these
      emails? Alerts? Full bills?

      i.  Each day, they get 5-25 emails that all a different topic,
          could be family planning etc etc -- topic based -- a few of
          those, statenet has their own term searches to collect
          similar.

      ii. [reports@statenet.com](mailto:reports@statenet.com)

      iii. Key words AND Categories

    - How do you decide what bills from the email are applicable?
      Basically, what bills do you track?

      i.  They read through the bills

      ii. Sometimes the email itself will flag some words but other
          times they read through the words entirely

      iii. Bills related to provision and access of care itself, human
           read through

    - Statenet relationship

      i.  At the beginning of last year, folks here reviewed the
          keywords to acknowledge some missing bills due to missing key
          words

      ii. We can technically search anything

      iii. Then there is the decision to want to track it

      iv. Statenet also has categories like "Family Planning Bills"

      v.  Guttmacher asked to add a bunch of tags in statenet -- and
          that's how they will know

    - THE EXPORT IS USED TO THEN GO BACK INTO STATENET

      i.  TRACKED → The bill shows up in the export to change in status

    - Is the Excel sheet Mollie generates a raw export, or does she
      format it first?

    - Can I see what the Access interface looks like? I could wait to
      talk to Lenny about this!

    - What are StateNet tags vs how you categorize in Access? ☑️

2.  Process Details![](media/image1.png){width="6.5in" height="4.0in"}

    - **Could you show me exactly what happens between getting the Excel
      file and updating Access? What\'s most time-consuming there?**

    - **When you update records - what fields are you actually
      touching?**

    - How long does a typical import usually take? When you say import,
      do you mean importing statenet files to access?

      i.  Import is the manual process of filling out the forms!

    - What makes some records trickier to update than others?

      i.  Some bills are thousands of words and some bills are a
          sentence, some bills

    - When you say tracked bills - what makes a bill tracked vs not?

      i.  Marking as tracked in statenet, so you get a changelog from
          the export

    - What\'s in Asana - just the imports or other tracking too?

      i.  The only thing that's really in asana is "us" giving the web
          team the CSV file and sometimes mollie will put the export
          into asana -- just for task management

      ii. The whole institute uses asana for communicating between
          divisions and within teams

    - **Special Focus: Enacted Bills Report Process → ASK MOLLIE**

      i.  Current Understanding:

          1.  Run \"All Passed1 to Enact to Veto\" query

          2.  Create two versions:

              a.  Full list for SiX

              b.  Abortion-only list for ACN/NAF

          3.  Distribute to multiple partners in batches

      ii. Questions About Reports

          1.  Is this Passed1 to Enact query something you run outside
              of the bi-monthly reports too?

          2.  Do you ever need to modify these exports for different
              audiences/requests?

          3.  Are there other regular exports like this that go to
              different partners?

          4.  Any challenges with the current report format/fields that
              we should know about?

3.  Workload Division

    - I see you\'re experimenting with splitting by topic - how\'s that
      going?

      i.  There are some number of topics, maybe 10-20 that they get
          emails about, mollie and talia just split that up.

      ii. Everything else is, pull the export from statenet from
          movement.

    - What\'s working/not working with the current task division in
      Asana?

    - Between StateNet email and final Access update - roughly how many
      days?

    - What takes longer - initial entry or bi-monthly updates?

4.  Quality Checks

    - **Walk me through a typical scenario where you need to consult
      Kimya**

    - What helps you catch potential issues before legal review?

    - How do you handle bills that touch multiple topics?

    - What helps you stay consistent between you and Mollie?

    - How do you track what Peter has edited?

    - How do you check if web updates worked correctly?

5.  Transition Concerns

    - What parts of the current process, despite being manual, really
      need to be preserved?

    - What would make the bi-monthly website updates easier?

    - Any concerns about moving away from Access?

    - Any thoughts on the rules/regs tracking gap?

      i.  They get just as many emails from statnet that includes
          regulations that contains bills. They track it on statenet
          either way, but don't later.

Meeting Notes

- They review pre-filed bills

- 2025 database copies it all, and then deletes everything that doesn't
  apply

- Important -- GROUP BY STATE

- Policy / Subpolicy → is a creation of access, isn't necessarily a
  valid organizing principle

- Positive, Neutral, Restrictive, Pushback → tags but are another
  cateogriy

- Krystal isn't involved w tracking process

- Once we have the website view, Kimya will use legal experience to help
  with that

- Peter will do editing for website

- In asana, once there are bills that have been enacted, tasks

  - Website blurb

  - Peter from editing team → word document, blank, write the
    description -- take from access -- writing sentences for the twice a
    month emails -- and then

  - Approval from approval

  - Then website

Action items

- [tcurhan@guttmacher.org](mailto:tcurhan@guttmacher.org)
  forwards Fryda lots of the statenet emails that are topic based that
  they receive

- Maybe fryda gets statenet login

- [tcurhan@guttmacher.org](mailto:tcurhan@guttmacher.org)
  writes some very basic plain language questions to ask the database as
  a check box for fryda
