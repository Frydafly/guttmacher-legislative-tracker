## Current System (Phase 1)

We have implemented a policy tracking system in Airtable that processes
legislative data through several stages:

1\. **Data Collection & Processing**

\- Weekly StateNet CSV imports

\- Automated field mapping and change detection

\- Multi-stage review process (Policy, Legal, Editorial)

2\. **Core Functions**

\- Structured bill data storage

\- Policy classification system

\- Status tracking

\- Public content generation

3\. **Current Export Capabilities**

\- XML generation for website updates

\- CSV exports possible if desired

\- Partner-specific reports

\- Analysis dashboard views

## Integration Requirements

We need to understand:

\- Your preferred XML schema and required fields

\- Ideal update frequency and delivery method

\- Any specific data format requirements

\- Integration timeline preferences

## Future Possibilities (Phase 2)

Once we understand your needs, we can explore:

\- Direct API access through Airtable

\- Real-time data updates

\- Custom data views and filters

\- Advanced analytics integration, including backups to BigQuery data
warehouse

## Next Steps

1\. Review our current architecture

2\. Share your XML requirements

3\. Discuss integration preferences

4\. Plan implementation timeline
