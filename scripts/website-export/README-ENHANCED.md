# Enhanced Website Export Script

## üöÄ Overview

The Enhanced Website Export Script is an improved version of the standard website export that adds real-time validation, quality reporting, and comprehensive analytics. It maintains the full export approach while providing better visibility, error handling, and data quality tracking.

### Key Enhancements

- **üîç Pre-flight Validation**: Comprehensive checks before export starts
- **üìä Real-time Progress Tracking**: Live updates during processing
- **üìà Quality Scoring**: Automated data quality assessment (0-100 score)
- **üí° Smart Recommendations**: Actionable insights based on data analysis
- **üìù Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive summaries with metrics and analytics
- **üóÑÔ∏è Quality History**: Tracks quality trends over time

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Required Tables

Before running the enhanced export, you need to create the following table in your Airtable base:

#### Export Quality Reports Table

This table stores quality metrics and reports from each export run.

1. **Create New Table**
   - Name: `Export Quality Reports`
   - Icon: üìä (optional)

2. **Add Fields** (exact names required):

| Field Name | Field Type | Configuration | Description |
|------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| `Export Date` | Date | Include time ON, Use GMT | When the export was run |
| `Quality Score` | Number | Integer, 0 decimals, Min: 0, Max: 100 | Overall quality score |
| `Grade` | Single Line Text | - | Letter grade (A+, A, B, C, D, F) |
| `Total Records` | Number | Integer, 0 decimals | Total bills processed |
| `Success Rate` | Number | Decimal, 1 decimal place | Percentage of successful exports |
| `Duration (seconds)` | Number | Decimal, 1 decimal place | How long the export took |
| `Completeness Score` | Number | Integer, 0 decimals | Data completeness component |
| `Accuracy Score` | Number | Integer, 0 decimals | Data accuracy component |
| `Consistency Score` | Number | Integer, 0 decimals | Data consistency component |
| `Missing Blurbs` | Number | Integer, 0 decimals | Count of bills missing descriptions |
| `Date Errors` | Number | Integer, 0 decimals | Count of date validation errors |
| `States Count` | Number | Integer, 0 decimals | Number of states with bills |
| `Recommendations` | Long Text | - | JSON array of recommendations |
| `Full Report` | Long Text | - | Complete JSON report |

### Step 2: Install the Script

1. **Copy Script Content**
   - Copy the entire content of `website-export-enhanced.js`

2. **Create Script in Airtable**
   - Go to Extensions ‚Üí Scripting
   - Create new script named "Website Export Enhanced"
   - Paste the script content
   - Save

### Step 3: Configure Field Names (if needed)

If your field names differ from the defaults, update the CONFIG object at the top of the script:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    FIELDS: {
        BILL_ID: 'BillID',  // Update these to match your field names
        STATE: 'State',
        // ... etc
    }
};
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Running the Export

1. **Open the Script**
   - Extensions ‚Üí Website Export Enhanced
   - Click "Run"

2. **Pre-flight Validation**
   - Script automatically checks for:
     - Future dates
     - Missing website blurbs
     - Duplicate bills
     - Incomplete records
   - Review the validation report
   - Choose to continue or cancel

3. **Monitor Progress**
   - Watch the real-time progress bar
   - See success/failure counts update live
   - Processing speed displayed

4. **Review Results**
   - Quality score and grade
   - Detailed statistics
   - Coverage analysis
   - Recommendations for improvement

### Understanding the Quality Score

The quality score (0-100) consists of three components:

#### Completeness (40%)
- Checks if bills have all required fields
- Tracks missing website blurbs
- Higher score = more complete data

#### Accuracy (40%)
- Validates date formats
- Checks for future dates
- Detects data format errors
- Higher score = fewer errors

#### Consistency (20%)
- Identifies duplicate bills
- Checks data relationships
- Higher score = cleaner data

### Grade Scale
- **A+ (95-100)**: Exceptional data quality
- **A (90-94)**: Excellent, minimal issues
- **B (85-89)**: Good, some improvements needed
- **C (80-84)**: Fair, several issues to address
- **D (70-79)**: Poor, significant problems
- **F (Below 70)**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention

**Actions**:
1. Address critical issues first
2. Run data cleanup scripts
3. Fix date validation errors
4. Remove duplicate bills
