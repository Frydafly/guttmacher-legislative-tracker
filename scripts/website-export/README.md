# Guttmacher Policy Tracker: Website Export Script

## üìù Overview

This Airtable script automates the export of legislative bill data from the Policy Tracker to a format compatible with the external website display. It performs a complete refresh of the export table each time it runs, ensuring the website always has the most current data.

## üåü Key Features

- Complete refresh of export data (deletes old records before creating new ones)
- Proper formatting of dates and policy fields
- Extraction of subpolicies from legislative data
- Mapping of intent tags (Protective, Neutral, Restrictive)
- Conversion of legislative dates to boolean flags when needed
- Comprehensive export statistics
- Detailed error reporting

## üîß Prerequisites

- Airtable base with two tables:
  1. "Bills" table - containing tracked legislation
  2. "Website Exports" table - destination for formatted export data

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Prepare Bills for Export**:
   - Complete the "Website Blurb" field with the public-facing description
   - Check the "Ready for Website" checkbox
   - Ensure all policy fields are properly categorized

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Navigate to the Automations or Scripts panel
   - Run the "Website Export" script
   - The script will clear the export table and populate it with fresh data

3. **Download Export Data**:
   - After the script completes, navigate to the Website Exports table
   - Download as CSV
   - Provide to the website team

## üîç What Gets Exported

The script transforms and exports the following fields:

### Core Bill Information

- State
- BillType
- BillNumber
- Ballot Initiative (derived from Action Type)
- Court Case (derived from Action Type)

### Content

- WebsiteBlurb
- Subpolicy1-10 (from Specific Policies)

### Status and Dates

- Last Action Date
- IntroducedDate
- Passed1ChamberDate
- Passed 2 Chamber (Boolean: 1/0 based on PassedLegislature date)
- PassedLegislature
- VetoedDate
- EnactedDate

### Intent Tags

- Positive (1/0 if Intent includes "Protective")
- Neutral (1/0 if Intent includes "Neutral")
- Restrictive (1/0 if Intent includes "Restrictive")

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The script uses a CONFIG object to map fields. If your field names differ, update this section:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    FIELDS: {
        BILL_ID: 'BillID',
        STATE: 'State',
        BILL_TYPE: 'BillType',
        BILL_NUMBER: 'BillNumber',
        LAST_ACTION: 'Last Action',
        INTENT: 'Intent (access)',
        SPECIFIC_POLICIES_ACCESS: 'Specific Policies (access)',
        WEBSITE_BLURB: 'Website Blurb',
        READY_FOR_WEBSITE: 'Ready for Website',
        INTRODUCED_DATE: 'Introduction Date',
        PASSED1_CHAMBER_DATE: 'Passed 1 Chamber Date',
        PASSED_LEGISLATURE_DATE: 'Passed Legislature Date',
        VETOED_DATE: 'Vetoed Date',
        ENACTED_DATE: 'Enacted Date',
        ACTION_TYPE: 'Action Type'
    }
};
```

## üìä Export Summary

Each export generates a detailed report including:

- Export statistics (processed, successful, errors)
- Intent breakdown (Positive/Neutral/Restrictive)
- State breakdown
- Any errors encountered

Example summary:

```plaintext
üìä Statistics
- Total records processed: 125
- Successfully exported: 123
- Errors encountered: 2

üìë Intent Breakdown
- Restrictive: 62
- Positive: 45
- Neutral: 16

üåé State Breakdown
- TX: 15
- FL: 12
- NY: 10
...
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Field Not Found Errors**:
   - Ensure all field names in CONFIG match exactly what's in your Airtable
   - Check for typos in field names
   - Verify that all required fields exist in your tables

2. **No Records Being Exported**:
   - Confirm bills have the "Ready for Website" checkbox checked
   - Verify "Website Blurb" fields are filled out
   - Check filter conditions if customized

3. **Date Formatting Issues**:
   - The script attempts to normalize various date formats
   - Check for malformed dates in your source data

4. **Error with Batch Processing**:
   - The script processes records in batches of 50 (Airtable limit)
   - For large exports, watch for timeout errors

### Field Requirements

These fields must be properly set up in your Bills table:

- State (Single select)
- BillType (Single select)
- BillNumber (Text)
- Website Blurb (Long text)
- Ready for Website (Checkbox)
- Date fields (various)
- Intent fields (Multiple select)

4. Website team uploads and processes the data

Typically, this process happens bi-monthly (1st and 15th of each month).
