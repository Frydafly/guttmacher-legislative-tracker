If comprehensive_bills_authentic is converting NULLs to FALSE or filtering records:

üéØ USE: all_historical_bills_unified for Google Sheets
   - Preserves authentic NULL vs FALSE distinction  
   - Shows true data evolution patterns
   - Authentic representation of what was tracked when

‚ö†Ô∏è  AVOID: comprehensive_bills_authentic if it's masking data reality
   - May be designed for dashboards that need clean data
   - Could be converting NULLs to FALSE for visualization
   - Obscures the methodology evolution story
