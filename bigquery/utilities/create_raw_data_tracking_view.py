This view provides two critical metrics for each field:

1. **Tracking %**: What percentage of bills had this field tracked (NOT NULL)
   - 0% = Field didn't exist that year
   - 100% = Field was systematically tracked for all bills

2. **True Rate When Tracked**: Of the bills where the field was tracked, what % were marked TRUE
   - Shows actual activity/marking patterns
   - Only calculated when field was being tracked

Key columns:
- *_tracking_pct: Shows field evolution (when tracking started)
- *_true_rate_when_tracked: Shows marking patterns (when tracked, what was marked TRUE)
- tracked_*_bills: Raw count of bills where field was tracked
- marked_*_true: Raw count of bills marked TRUE

Dashboard Use Cases:
- Line chart: tracking percentages over time (shows when fields were introduced)
- Bar chart: true rates when tracked (shows actual policy activity)
- Heatmap: tracking vs marking patterns
- Table: year-by-year field evolution summary
