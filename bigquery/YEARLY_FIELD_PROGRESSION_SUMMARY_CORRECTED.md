# What Was Actually Tracked Each Year - Field Evolution Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis shows **what fields were actually tracked** vs **what was marked TRUE** in each year's original database. Key findings:

- **Field tracking evolution**: Many fields didn't exist in early years, then were added systematically
- **Data marking patterns**: When fields were tracked, they show meaningful TRUE/FALSE patterns
- **Missing vs not tracked**: 0% TRUE often means "field didn't exist yet" not "no activity"

## Field Tracking Evolution by Year

### Basic Data Collection (Always Tracked)
| Year | State | Bill Number | Description | History |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 2002 | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% |
| 2006 | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ✅ 81% | ✅ 80% |
| 2016 | ✅ 100% | ✅ 99% | ✅ 93% | ✅ 99% |
| 2022 | ✅ 100% | ✅ 98% | ✅ 94% | ✅ 100% |

**Status**: Core data collection fields present from the beginning and remain consistently tracked.

### Bill Classification Evolution
| Year | Bill Type | Internal Summary | Website Blurb |
|------|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| 2002 | ❌ **Not tracked** | ❌ **Not tracked** | ❌ **Not tracked** |
| 2006 | ✅ **Tracking begins** (100%) | ⚠️ **Limited** (14%) | ❌ **Not tracked** |
| 2016 | ✅ **Consistent** (99%) | ⚠️ **Limited** (13%) | ⚠️ **Sporadic** (16%) |
| 2019 | ✅ **Consistent** (100%) | ✅ **Systematic** (67%) | ⚠️ **Limited** (6%) |
| 2022 | ✅ **Consistent** (98%) | ✅ **Strong** (91%) | ⚠️ **Limited** (13%) |

**Key Evolution**: Bill type tracking begins 2006. Internal summaries become systematic only in 2019.

### Date Tracking Evolution
| Year | Introduced Date | Last Action Date | Effective Date | Enacted Date |
|------|----------------|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 2002 | ❌ **Not tracked** | ✅ **Tracked** (99%) | ❌ **Not tracked** | ❌ **Not tracked** |
| 2006 | ❌ **Not tracked** | ❌ **Stopped** (0%) | ⚠️ **Limited** (16%) | ❌ **Not tracked** |
| 2009 | ❌ **Not tracked** | ✅ **Resumed** (100%) | ⚠️ **Limited** (15%) | ❌ **Not tracked** |
| 2016 | ✅ **Tracking begins** (100%) | ✅ **Consistent** (99%) | ⚠️ **Limited** (13%) | ⚠️ **Limited** (13%) |
| 2022 | ✅ **Consistent** (100%) | ✅ **Consistent** (100%) | ⚠️ **Limited** (14%) | ⚠️ **Limited** (14%) |

**Major Gap**: Introduced dates not tracked until 2016! Last action dates had gap 2006-2008.

## Legislative Status Tracking Evolution

### Modern Status Fields (Post-2006 Methodology)
| Year | Introduced Field | Enacted Field | Dead Field | Pending Field |
|------|------------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 2002 | ❌ **Different methodology** | ❌ **Different methodology** | ❌ **Different methodology** | ❌ **Different methodology** |
| 2006 | ✅ **Modern tracking begins** | ✅ **Modern tracking begins** | ✅ **Modern tracking begins** | ✅ **Modern tracking begins** |
| 2022 | ✅ **Consistently tracked** | ✅ **Consistently tracked** | ✅ **Consistently tracked** | ✅ **Consistently tracked** |

**When tracked, what was marked TRUE:**
- **Introduced**: 94-100% marked TRUE (when field existed)
- **Enacted**: 8-54% marked TRUE (varies by year and methodology)
- **Dead**: 55-75% marked TRUE (when modern methodology used)
- **Pending**: 15-82% marked TRUE (varies significantly)

**Critical Note**: 2002-2005 used different status methodology - cannot compare directly.

## Policy Category Tracking Evolution

### Core Policy Areas
| Field | 2002 | 2006 | 2009 | 2016 | 2022 | Evolution Pattern |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|-------------------|
| **Abortion** | ✅ 29% TRUE | ✅ 32% TRUE | ✅ 35% TRUE | ✅ 42% TRUE | ✅ 38% TRUE | **Tracked since beginning** |
| **Contraception** | ✅ 51% TRUE | ❌ **Stopped** (0%) | ✅ **Resumed** (9%) | ✅ 21% TRUE | ✅ 8% TRUE | **Gap 2006-2008** |
| **Minors** | ✅ 15% TRUE | ✅ 17% TRUE | ✅ 14% TRUE | ✅ 17% TRUE | ✅ 13% TRUE | **Always tracked** |
| **Sex Education** | ❌ **Not tracked** | ✅ **Tracking begins** (11%) | ✅ 14% TRUE | ✅ 8% TRUE | ✅ 5% TRUE | **Begins 2006** |
| **Insurance** | ✅ 18% TRUE | ✅ 5% TRUE | ✅ 9% TRUE | ✅ 12% TRUE | ✅ 8% TRUE | **Always tracked** |

### Emerging Policy Areas
| Field | First Tracked | 2006 | 2010 | 2016 | 2019 | 2022 | Evolution |
|-------|---------------|------|------|------|------|------|-----------|
| **Pregnancy** | 2010 | ❌ **Not tracked** | ✅ **Begins** (3%) | ✅ 11% TRUE | ✅ 18% TRUE | ✅ 23% TRUE | **Growing focus** |
| **Emergency Contraception** | 2006 | ✅ **Begins** (6%) | ✅ 4% TRUE | ✅ 2% TRUE | ✅ 2% TRUE | ✅ 1% TRUE | **Peak early, declining** |
| **Period Products** | 2019 | ❌ **Not tracked** | ❌ **Not tracked** | ❌ **Not tracked** | ✅ **Begins** (0.3%) | ✅ 3% TRUE | **Very recent** |
| **Incarceration** | 2019 | ❌ **Not tracked** | ❌ **Not tracked** | ❌ **Not tracked** | ✅ **Begins** (3%) | ✅ 3% TRUE | **Very recent** |

**Key Insight**: When a field shows 0% TRUE, check if it was tracked that year. Many "0%" are actually "field didn't exist yet."

## Intent Classification Evolution

### Political Intent Tracking
| Year | Positive Field | Neutral Field | Restrictive Field | Total Classification |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 2002-2005 | ❌ **Not tracked** | ❌ **Not tracked** | ❌ **Not tracked** | **No intent tracking** |
| 2006 | ✅ **Begins** (21% TRUE) | ✅ **Begins** (28% TRUE) | ❌ **Not tracked** | **Positive/Neutral only** |
| 2009 | ✅ 29% TRUE | ✅ 40% TRUE | ✅ **Restrictive begins** (36% TRUE) | **Full classification** |
| 2016 | ✅ 42% TRUE | ✅ 13% TRUE | ✅ 46% TRUE | **Mature methodology** |
| 2022 | ✅ 62% TRUE | ✅ 5% TRUE | ✅ 35% TRUE | **Current patterns** |

**Evolution Insight**: 
- **2006**: Intent classification introduced (positive/neutral only)
- **2009**: Restrictive category added - major methodological enhancement
- **2009+**: Bills can have multiple intents (totals can exceed 100%)

## Understanding the Data: Tracked vs Marked

### Field Status Categories:
1. **❌ Not Tracked**: Field didn't exist in database that year (0% coverage)
2. **⚠️ Limited**: Field existed but rarely populated (1-30% coverage)
3. **✅ Tracked**: Field systematically collected (30%+ coverage)
4. **% TRUE**: When tracked, percentage actively marked as TRUE

### Critical Distinctions:

#### **"Not Tracked" vs "No Activity"**:
- **Contraception 2006-2008**: Field didn't exist (methodology gap)
- **Period Products 2002-2018**: Field didn't exist (policy didn't exist yet)
- **Introduced Date 2002-2015**: Field didn't exist (different tracking approach)

#### **"Tracked" vs "Marked TRUE"**:
- **Sex Education 2006**: Field existed (11% marked TRUE, 89% marked FALSE)
- **Dead Status 2022**: Field existed (61% marked TRUE, 39% marked FALSE)
- **Abortion 2022**: Field existed (38% marked TRUE, 62% marked FALSE)

✅ Maximum data richness

## Summary: Evolution of Legislative Tracking

**2002-2005**: Basic policy identification, different status methodology
**2006**: Modern status tracking begins, intent classification introduced
**2009**: Restrictive intent added, pregnancy tracking begins (2010)
**2016**: Date tracking completion, full timeline data available
**2019**: Rich summaries, emerging policy areas, maximum comprehensiveness

The data shows **methodological evolution**, not missing data. Each era has different analytical capabilities based on what was actually tracked.
