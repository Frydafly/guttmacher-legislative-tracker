### Years Failed (3):
- **2014**: Data type issue with bill_number field
- **2015**: Data type issue with topic_3 field  
- **2024**: No tables found in database file

## Data Consistency Analysis

### NULL vs FALSE Implementation
✅ **Correctly implemented** as designed:
- **Status fields** (enacted, vetoed, etc.) → Default to `FALSE` when missing
- **Category fields** (abortion, contraception, etc.) → Default to `NULL` when not tracked
- **Intent fields** (positive, neutral, restrictive) → Default to `NULL` when not tracked

### Field Evolution Tracking
The migration successfully handles field name changes over time:
- "Teen Issues" (2005) → "Minors" (2010+)
- "Family Planning/MCH" (2005) → "Contraception" (2015+)
- "EC" (2009) → "Emergency Contraception" (2015+)

### Data Volume Trends
- **Early years (2002-2005)**: ~100-200 bills/year (initial tracking phase)
- **Peak years (2006-2019)**: ~800-1,200 bills/year (full tracking)
- **Recent years (2020-2022)**: ~500-1,800 bills/year (varies by legislative activity)

## Created BigQuery Assets

### Individual Year Tables (19):
- `historical_bills_2002` through `historical_bills_2022`
- Each contains that year's legislative data with harmonized schema

### Analytics Views (6):
1. `all_historical_bills_unified` - Master view combining all years
2. `looker_bills_dashboard` - Main dashboard view
3. `looker_comprehensive_bills` - Detailed bill analysis
4. `looker_state_summary` - State-level aggregations
5. `looker_time_series` - Temporal analysis
6. `looker_topic_analysis` - Policy topic breakdowns

## Field Consistency Analysis

We analyzed all 16,323 bills across the 18 successfully migrated years to determine which fields are most consistently populated:

### Most Consistent Fields (Available in ALL years):

#### 1. Basic Identifiers (95%+ populated):
- **state** - 100% populated across all years
- **bill_number** - 99.4% populated (missing in only 0.6% of records)
- **description** - 92.2% populated (high quality bill descriptions)
- **bill_type** - 95.9% populated (improved from 55% to 99% over time)

#### 2. Status Fields (100% populated due to FALSE defaults):
All status fields are available for every single bill across all years:
- `introduced`, `enacted`, `vetoed`, `dead`, `pending`
- `passed_first_chamber`, `passed_second_chamber` 
- `seriously_considered`

#### 3. Policy Categories (100% populated - NULL when not tracked):
All policy category fields exist for every bill, using NULL to indicate "not tracked for this bill":
- **Core categories**: `abortion`, `contraception`, `minors`, `sex_education`, `insurance`
- **Additional categories**: `emergency_contraception`, `pregnancy`, `stis`, `appropriations`
- **Recent additions**: `incarceration`, `period_products`, `fetal_issues`, `fetal_tissue`, `refusal`

#### 4. Intent Classification (100% populated - NULL when not tracked):
- `positive`, `neutral`, `restrictive` - All bills have these fields, NULL indicates unclassified

### Fields with Dramatic Improvement Over Time:

| Field | 2002-2010 Avg | 2015+ Avg | Improvement |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **bill_type** | 55.5% | 99.0% | +43.5% |
| **introduced_date** | 0.0% | 95.0% | +95.0% |
| **last_action_date** | 66.5% | 96.3% | +29.8% |
| **internal_summary** | 8.1% | 44.8% | +36.7% |

### Rarely Populated Fields:
- **effective_date** - Only 12.6% populated overall
- **enacted_date** - Only 5.8% populated overall
- **introduced_date** - 47.7% overall (but 95%+ in recent years)
- **internal_summary** - 29.5% overall (but 45%+ in recent years)

### Year-by-Year Data Quality Insights:

**2002-2005 (Early Years)**:
- Perfect consistency for core fields
- No date tracking except last_action_date
- No bill type classification
- All policy categories tracked from the beginning

**2006-2015 (Expansion Period)**:
- Bill type classification introduced (2006)
- Internal summaries begin appearing (2006)
- Effective date tracking improves
- All core policy categories remain consistent

**2016-2022 (Modern Era)**:
- Near-perfect data quality (95%+ for most fields)
- Introduced date tracking begins (2016)
- Internal summaries become common (45%+)
- New policy categories added but properly tracked

## Key Findings for Team

### What You Can Reliably Analyze Across All 18 Years:
1. **Legislative outcomes** - All status fields are 100% consistent
2. **Policy categories** - All categories tracked consistently (NULL = not applicable)
3. **Geographic patterns** - State field is 100% populated
4. **Bill identification** - 99.4% have bill numbers
5. **Intent analysis** - Classification available (though may be NULL for unclassified bills)

### What Requires Year-Specific Consideration:
1. **Date analyses** - Only last_action_date reliable before 2016
2. **Bill type analyses** - Limited before 2006
3. **Internal summaries** - Sparse before 2015
4. **Specific subcategories** - Some added over time but properly NULL when not applicable

## TRUE/FALSE Population Analysis (Data Richness)

Beyond field existence, we analyzed which fields have meaningful TRUE/FALSE data vs mostly NULL values:

### High-Value Status Fields (Rich Data for Analysis):
| Field | TRUE Rate | Description | Analysis Value |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **introduced** | 94.2% | Bill was introduced | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| **dead** | 54.6% | Bill failed/died | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| **pending** | 26.5% | Bill is still active | ⭐⭐⭐ Good |
| **enacted** | 12.8% | Bill became law | ⭐⭐⭐ Good |
| **seriously_considered** | 7.4% | Received serious consideration | ⭐⭐ Moderate |
| **passed_first_chamber** | 6.9% | Passed first chamber | ⭐⭐ Moderate |

### Low-Activity Status Fields:
- **vetoed**: 1.1% TRUE (rare but important when it happens)
- **passed_second_chamber**: 0.7% TRUE (very rare events)

### Most Valuable Policy Categories for Analysis:
| Field | TRUE Rate | Analysis Potential |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **abortion** | 38.1% | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent - largest category |
| **minors** | 14.3% | ⭐⭐⭐ Good coverage |
| **pregnancy** | 10.9% | ⭐⭐⭐ Good coverage |
| **contraception** | 10.6% | ⭐⭐⭐ Good coverage |
| **insurance** | 10.2% | ⭐⭐⭐ Good coverage |
| **sex_education** | 8.8% | ⭐⭐ Moderate coverage |
| **appropriations** | 5.2% | ⭐⭐ Moderate coverage |
| **emergency_contraception** | 2.6% | ⭐ Low but trackable |

### Intent Classification Coverage:
- **88.4% of all bills have intent classification** - excellent for analysis!
  - **Restrictive**: 31.2% (5,095 bills)
  - **Positive**: 40.0% (6,529 bills) 
  - **Neutral**: 17.2% (2,808 bills)

### Emerging Policy Areas:
- **incarceration**: 0.8% TRUE (130 bills) - growing trend
- **period_products**: 0.4% TRUE (65 bills) - very recent policy area

## What This Means for Analysis

### **Excellent Analysis Potential** (Rich TRUE/FALSE data):
1. **Legislative outcomes** - 94% introduced, 13% enacted, 55% died
2. **Abortion policy** - 38% of all bills (6,220 bills)
3. **Intent analysis** - 88% classified (14,432 bills)
4. **Core policy areas** - Minors, pregnancy, contraception all 10%+

### **Moderate Analysis Potential** (Some TRUE values):
1. **Advanced legislative process** - First chamber passage, serious consideration
2. **Funding bills** - Appropriations (5% = 850 bills)
3. **Education policy** - Sex education (9% = 1,440 bills)

### **Limited but Meaningful** (Rare but important events):
1. **Vetoes** - Only 1% but politically significant (180 bills)
2. **Bicameral passage** - 0.7% but shows full legislative success
3. **Emerging issues** - Period products, incarceration policies

### Data Quality Summary:
- **Excellent**: Core tracking has been remarkably consistent since 2002
- **Improved**: Date tracking and bill classification dramatically improved after 2015
- **Reliable**: The NULL vs FALSE implementation ensures accurate analysis
- **Complete**: 100% of bills have all status and category fields (with appropriate NULL/FALSE values)
- **Rich**: 88% intent classification, 38% abortion coverage, 55% outcome determination

## Next Steps
1. Fix data issues for 2014, 2015, and 2024 (can be done with `add_year.py`)
2. Connect Looker Studio to the created views
3. Begin historical analysis with 18 years of clean data
4. Consider creating additional specialized analytics views as needed
