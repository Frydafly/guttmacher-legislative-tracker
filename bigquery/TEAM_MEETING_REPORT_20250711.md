### Years Failed (3):
- **2014**: Data type issue with bill_number field
- **2015**: Data type issue with topic_3 field  
- **2024**: No tables found in database file

## Data Consistency Analysis

### NULL vs FALSE Implementation
✅ **Correctly implemented** as designed:
- **Status fields** (enacted, vetoed, etc.) → Default to `FALSE` when missing
- **Category fields** (abortion, contraception, etc.) → Default to `NULL` when not tracked
- **Intent fields** (positive, neutral, restrictive) → Default to `NULL` when not tracked

### Field Evolution Tracking
The migration successfully handles field name changes over time:
- "Teen Issues" (2005) → "Minors" (2010+)
- "Family Planning/MCH" (2005) → "Contraception" (2015+)
- "EC" (2009) → "Emergency Contraception" (2015+)

### Data Volume Trends
- **Early years (2002-2005)**: ~100-200 bills/year (initial tracking phase)
- **Peak years (2006-2019)**: ~800-1,200 bills/year (full tracking)
- **Recent years (2020-2022)**: ~500-1,800 bills/year (varies by legislative activity)

## Created BigQuery Assets

### Individual Year Tables (19):
- `historical_bills_2002` through `historical_bills_2022`
- Each contains that year's legislative data with harmonized schema

### Analytics Views (6):
1. `all_historical_bills_unified` - Master view combining all years
2. `looker_bills_dashboard` - Main dashboard view
3. `looker_comprehensive_bills` - Detailed bill analysis
4. `looker_state_summary` - State-level aggregations
5. `looker_time_series` - Temporal analysis
6. `looker_topic_analysis` - Policy topic breakdowns

## Field Consistency Analysis

We analyzed all 16,323 bills across the 18 successfully migrated years to determine which fields are most consistently populated:

### Most Consistent Fields (Available in ALL years):

#### 1. Basic Identifiers (95%+ populated):
- **state** - 100% populated across all years
- **bill_number** - 99.4% populated (missing in only 0.6% of records)
- **description** - 92.2% populated (high quality bill descriptions)
- **bill_type** - 95.9% populated (improved from 55% to 99% over time)

#### 2. Status Fields (100% populated due to FALSE defaults):
All status fields are available for every single bill across all years:
- `introduced`, `enacted`, `vetoed`, `dead`, `pending`
- `passed_first_chamber`, `passed_second_chamber` 
- `seriously_considered`

#### 3. Policy Categories (100% populated - NULL when not tracked):
All policy category fields exist for every bill, using NULL to indicate "not tracked for this bill":
- **Core categories**: `abortion`, `contraception`, `minors`, `sex_education`, `insurance`
- **Additional categories**: `emergency_contraception`, `pregnancy`, `stis`, `appropriations`
- **Recent additions**: `incarceration`, `period_products`, `fetal_issues`, `fetal_tissue`, `refusal`

#### 4. Intent Classification (100% populated - NULL when not tracked):
- `positive`, `neutral`, `restrictive` - All bills have these fields, NULL indicates unclassified

### Fields with Dramatic Improvement Over Time:

| Field | 2002-2010 Avg | 2015+ Avg | Improvement |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **bill_type** | 55.5% | 99.0% | +43.5% |
| **introduced_date** | 0.0% | 95.0% | +95.0% |
| **last_action_date** | 66.5% | 96.3% | +29.8% |
| **internal_summary** | 8.1% | 44.8% | +36.7% |

### Rarely Populated Fields:
- **effective_date** - Only 12.6% populated overall
- **enacted_date** - Only 5.8% populated overall
- **introduced_date** - 47.7% overall (but 95%+ in recent years)
- **internal_summary** - 29.5% overall (but 45%+ in recent years)

### Year-by-Year Data Quality Insights:

**2002-2005 (Early Years)**:
- Perfect consistency for core fields
- No date tracking except last_action_date
- No bill type classification
- All policy categories tracked from the beginning

**2006-2015 (Expansion Period)**:
- Bill type classification introduced (2006)
- Internal summaries begin appearing (2006)
- Effective date tracking improves
- All core policy categories remain consistent

**2016-2022 (Modern Era)**:
- Near-perfect data quality (95%+ for most fields)
- Introduced date tracking begins (2016)
- Internal summaries become common (45%+)
- New policy categories added but properly tracked

## Key Findings for Team

### What You Can Reliably Analyze Across All 18 Years:
1. **Legislative outcomes** - All status fields are 100% consistent
2. **Policy categories** - All categories tracked consistently (NULL = not applicable)
3. **Geographic patterns** - State field is 100% populated
4. **Bill identification** - 99.4% have bill numbers
5. **Intent analysis** - Classification available (though may be NULL for unclassified bills)

### What Requires Year-Specific Consideration:
1. **Date analyses** - Only last_action_date reliable before 2016
2. **Bill type analyses** - Limited before 2006
3. **Internal summaries** - Sparse before 2015
4. **Specific subcategories** - Some added over time but properly NULL when not applicable

### Data Quality Summary:
- **Excellent**: Core tracking has been remarkably consistent since 2002
- **Improved**: Date tracking and bill classification dramatically improved after 2015
- **Reliable**: The NULL vs FALSE implementation ensures accurate analysis
- **Complete**: 100% of bills have all status and category fields (with appropriate NULL/FALSE values)

## Next Steps
1. Fix data issues for 2014, 2015, and 2024 (can be done with `add_year.py`)
2. Connect Looker Studio to the created views
3. Begin historical analysis with 18 years of clean data
4. Consider creating additional specialized analytics views as needed
