### Years Failed (3):
- **2014**: Data type issue with bill_number field
- **2015**: Data type issue with topic_3 field  
- **2024**: No tables found in database file

## Data Consistency Analysis

### NULL vs FALSE Implementation - Preserving Data Reality
✅ **Critical for understanding what was actually tracked**:
- **NULL** = Field didn't exist in original database that year (not tracked)
- **FALSE** = Field existed and was tracked, but marked as negative/not applicable
- **TRUE** = Field existed and was tracked, marked as positive/applicable

**Why this matters**:
- **Contraception 2006**: NULL (field didn't exist) vs 2022: FALSE (tracked but not applicable)
- **Introduced Date 2002**: NULL (dates not tracked yet) vs 2022: TRUE/FALSE (dates tracked)
- **Period Products 2018**: NULL (policy area didn't exist) vs 2022: TRUE/FALSE (tracked)

### Field Evolution Tracking
The migration successfully handles field name changes over time:
- "Teen Issues" (2005) → "Minors" (2010+)
- "Family Planning/MCH" (2005) → "Contraception" (2015+)
- "EC" (2009) → "Emergency Contraception" (2015+)

### Data Volume Trends
- **Early years (2002-2005)**: ~100-200 bills/year (initial tracking phase)
- **Peak years (2006-2019)**: ~800-1,200 bills/year (full tracking)
- **Recent years (2020-2022)**: ~500-1,800 bills/year (varies by legislative activity)

## Raw Data Collection Analysis - What Was Actually Tracked Each Year

This analysis focuses on what data was actually collected in each original database file, showing the evolution of the Guttmacher Institute's legislative tracking methodology from 2002-2022.

### Data Collection Evolution Summary:

#### **2002-2005 (Foundation Era)**: Basic Bill Identification
- **Focus**: Core policy identification and basic legislative outcomes
- **Strengths**: Excellent abortion (29-51%) and contraception (5-51%) tracking
- **Limitations**: No introduced dates, no bill types, different status methodology
- **Data available**: State, bill_number, description, last_action_date, basic status, core policy categories

#### **2006-2015 (Methodology Revolution)**: Modern Tracking Begins
- **Major breakthrough**: Introduction of modern legislative status tracking methodology
- **New capabilities**: Bill type classification, systematic status tracking (introduced, dead, pending)
- **Policy expansion**: Sex education tracking begins, intent classification introduced
- **Still developing**: Sporadic internal summaries, no introduced dates yet

#### **2016-2022 (Comprehensive Era)**: Full Data Collection
- **Complete dates**: Introduced date tracking finally systematic
- **Rich summaries**: Internal summaries become standard (2019+)
- **Emerging issues**: Period products, incarceration tracking added
- **Data maturity**: Near-complete coverage for most tracked fields

### What Can You Analyze by Time Period:

#### **All 18 Years (2002-2022)**:
✅ **Core policy identification** - Abortion, contraception, minors consistently tracked
✅ **Legislative outcomes** - Available but methodology evolved in 2006
✅ **Geographic patterns** - Perfect state identification throughout
✅ **Bill volumes and trends** - Reliable counts (107-1,848 bills/year)

#### **2006+ Only (17 years)**:
✅ **Modern legislative tracking** - Introduced, enacted, dead, pending status
✅ **Bill type analysis** - Classification available from 2006 forward
✅ **Intent classification** - Positive/neutral from 2006, restrictive from 2009
✅ **Sex education tracking** - Systematic identification from 2006

#### **2016+ Only (7 years)**:
✅ **Complete date analysis** - Introduced dates finally systematic
✅ **Legislative timeline analysis** - Can track bills from introduction to outcome
✅ **Process analysis** - Full legislative workflow data available

#### **2019+ Only (4 years)**:
✅ **Rich narrative analysis** - Internal summaries become standard
✅ **Emerging policy areas** - Period products, incarceration systematic
✅ **Full data richness** - All fields systematically collected

### Critical Methodological Changes to Understand:

#### **2006 Revolution**:
- **Status tracking methodology completely changed**
- **Before 2006**: Different approach to tracking legislative outcomes
- **2006+**: Modern boolean status fields (introduced, dead, pending, etc.)
- **Impact**: Cannot directly compare pre-2006 vs post-2006 outcome rates

#### **2009 Enhancement**:
- **Restrictive intent classification added**
- **Bills can now have multiple intent classifications**
- **Methodology matured for political analysis**

#### **2016 Completion**:
- **Introduced date tracking begins systematically**
- **First time full legislative timeline data available**
- **Process analysis becomes possible**

### Data Gaps and Limitations by Field:

#### **Date Fields**:
- `introduced_date`: **Missing entirely 2002-2015**, systematic 2016+
- `last_action_date`: **Gap 2006-2008**, otherwise good throughout
- `effective_date`: **Always sparse** (only 12% have dates across all years)
- `enacted_date`: **Always limited** (only 6% have dates across all years)

#### **Text Fields**:
- `internal_summary`: **Sporadic 2002-2018**, systematic 2019+ (67-91% coverage)
- `notes`: **Declining over time** (16-98% missing by recent years)
- `website_blurb`: **Inconsistent throughout** (0-100% missing varies by year)

#### **Policy Categories with Gaps**:
- `contraception`: **Complete gap 2006-2008**, otherwise tracked since 2002
- `pregnancy`: **Begins 2010**, then consistently tracked
- `period_products`: **Only 2019+**, very recent policy area
- `incarceration`: **Only 2019+**, emerging policy focus

This raw availability analysis shows that while we have 18 years of data, the **quality and comprehensiveness evolved dramatically** - especially with the 2006 methodology change and 2016 date tracking improvements.

## BigQuery View for Dashboard Integration

✅ **Created**: `raw_data_tracking_by_year` view in BigQuery
- **Location**: `guttmacher-legislative-tracker.legislative_tracker_historical.raw_data_tracking_by_year`
- **Purpose**: Shows what was actually tracked vs what was marked TRUE each year
- **Key metrics**:
  - **Tracking %**: Percentage of bills with field tracked (NULL vs NOT NULL)
  - **True Rate When Tracked**: Of tracked bills, percentage marked TRUE
- **Usage**: Ready for Looker Studio dashboard integration

**Sample Data**:
```
Year | Bills | BillType% | IntroDate% | Abortion% | AbortTrue% | Contracept% | ContractTrue%
2002 |  177 |     0.0% |      0.0% |    100.0% | 29.4%    |     100.0% | 51.4%      
2006 | 1099 |    99.9% |      0.0% |    100.0% | 32.1%    |     100.0% | N/A        
2016 | 1039 |    98.7% |    100.0% |    100.0% | 42.1%    |     100.0% | 20.6%      
2022 | 1848 |    98.1% |     99.7% |    100.0% | 37.9%    |     100.0% | 7.5%    
```

This shows the evolution: bill types begin 2006, introduced dates begin 2016, contraception tracking gaps 2006-2008.
