### Years Failed (3):
- **2014**: Data type issue with bill_number field
- **2015**: Data type issue with topic_3 field  
- **2024**: No tables found in database file

## Created BigQuery Assets

### Individual Year Tables (19):
- `historical_bills_2002` through `historical_bills_2022`
- Each contains that year's legislative data with harmonized schema

### Analytics Views (7):
1. `all_historical_bills_unified` - Master view combining all years
2. `looker_bills_dashboard` - Main dashboard view
3. `looker_comprehensive_bills` - Detailed bill analysis (materialized table)
4. `looker_state_summary` - State-level aggregations
5. `looker_time_series` - Temporal analysis
6. `looker_topic_analysis` - Policy topic breakdowns
7. `raw_data_tracking_by_year` - **NEW**: Shows field tracking evolution

## Key Technical Implementation

### NULL vs FALSE Implementation - Preserving Data Reality
✅ **Critical for understanding what was actually tracked**:
- **NULL** = Field didn't exist in original database that year (not tracked)
- **FALSE** = Field existed and was tracked, but marked as negative/not applicable
- **TRUE** = Field existed and was tracked, marked as positive/applicable

**Examples**:
- **Contraception 2006**: NULL (field didn't exist during methodology gap)
- **Introduced Date 2002**: NULL (dates not tracked until 2016)
- **Period Products 2018**: NULL (policy area didn't exist yet)

### Field Evolution Successfully Mapped:
- "Teen Issues" (2005) → "Minors" (2010+)
- "Family Planning/MCH" (2005) → "Contraception" (2015+)
- "EC" (2009) → "Emergency Contraception" (2015+)

## Data Collection Evolution - What Was Actually Tracked

### **2002-2005 (Foundation Era)**: Basic Bill Identification
- **Available**: State, bill_number, description, last_action_date, core policy categories
- **Policy tracking**: Abortion (29-51%), contraception (5-51%), minors (15%)
- **Missing**: No introduced dates, no bill types, different status methodology

### **2006-2015 (Methodology Revolution)**: Modern Tracking Begins
- **Major breakthrough**: Modern legislative status tracking (introduced, dead, pending)
- **New capabilities**: Bill type classification (100%), intent classification begins
- **Policy expansion**: Sex education tracking begins (11% in 2006)
- **Still developing**: No introduced dates, sporadic internal summaries

### **2016-2022 (Comprehensive Era)**: Full Data Collection
- **Complete dates**: Introduced date tracking finally systematic (99%+)
- **Rich summaries**: Internal summaries standard 2019+ (67-91% coverage)
- **Emerging issues**: Period products (2019+), incarceration tracking (2019+)

## Critical Methodological Changes

### 2006 Revolution:
- **Status tracking methodology completely changed**
- **Cannot directly compare pre-2006 vs post-2006 outcome rates**
- Modern boolean status fields introduced

### 2009 Enhancement:
- **Restrictive intent classification added**
- Bills can have multiple intent classifications

### 2016 Completion:
- **Introduced date tracking begins systematically**
- Full legislative timeline data available for first time

### 2019 Maturation:
- **Internal summary collection becomes standard**
- Emerging policy areas systematically tracked

## Analysis Capabilities by Time Period

### **All 18 Years (2002-2022)**:
✅ Core policy identification (abortion, contraception, minors)
✅ Geographic patterns (perfect state identification)
✅ Legislative volume trends
⚠️ Legislative outcomes (methodology changed 2006)

### **2006+ Only (17 years)**:
✅ Modern legislative status tracking
✅ Intent classification (positive/neutral from 2006, restrictive from 2009)
✅ Bill type analysis
✅ Sex education tracking

### **2016+ Only (7 years)**:
✅ Complete date analysis including introduced dates
✅ Full legislative timeline analysis
✅ Process analysis (introduction to outcome)

### **2019+ Only (4 years)**:
✅ Rich narrative analysis via internal summaries
✅ Emerging policy areas (period products, incarceration)
✅ Maximum data comprehensiveness

## Data Gaps and Limitations

### **Date Fields**:
- `introduced_date`: **Missing entirely 2002-2015**, systematic 2016+
- `last_action_date`: **Gap 2006-2008**, otherwise good
- `effective_date`: **Always sparse** (12% coverage)
- `enacted_date`: **Always limited** (6% coverage)

### **Policy Categories with Gaps**:
- `contraception`: **Complete gap 2006-2008**, otherwise consistent
- `pregnancy`: **Begins 2010**, then consistent
- `period_products`: **Only 2019+**, very recent
- `incarceration`: **Only 2019+**, emerging focus

### **Text Fields**:
- `internal_summary`: **Sporadic 2002-2018**, systematic 2019+
- `notes`: **Declining quality over time**
- `website_blurb`: **Inconsistent throughout**

## Dashboard Integration Ready

### `raw_data_tracking_by_year` View:
**Purpose**: Shows what was actually tracked vs what was marked TRUE each year
**Key metrics**:
- **Tracking %**: Percentage of bills with field tracked (NULL vs NOT NULL)
- **True Rate When Tracked**: Of tracked bills, percentage marked TRUE

**Sample Evolution Data**:
```
Year | Bills | BillType% | IntroDate% | Abortion% | AbortTrue%
2002 |  177 |     0.0% |      0.0% |    100.0% | 29.4%
2006 | 1099 |    99.9% |      0.0% |    100.0% | 32.1%
2016 | 1039 |    98.7% |    100.0% |    100.0% | 42.1%
2022 | 1848 |    98.1% |     99.7% |    100.0% | 37.9%
```

## Next Steps
1. **Fix missing years**: Use `add_year.py` for 2014, 2015, 2024
2. **Dashboard creation**: Connect Looker Studio to existing views
3. **Analysis begins**: 18 years of clean, properly structured data ready
4. **Field evolution insights**: Use `raw_data_tracking_by_year` for methodology documentation

## Key Insight for Team
**The data preserves the story of evolving legislative tracking methodology.** The NULL/FALSE distinction ensures you can distinguish between "not tracked that year" vs "tracked but negative", providing authentic analysis of both data availability and legislative patterns across two decades of policy evolution.
